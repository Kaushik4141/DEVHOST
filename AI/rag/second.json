        "explanation": "Motia is a multi-language, event-driven runtime manager that simplifies backend development by unifying various concerns such as APIs, background jobs, queues, workflows, AI agents, streaming, observability, and state management around a single core primitive called the Step. Motia aims to reduce the complexity of fragmented backend development by providing a simple and consistent way to express all these patterns.",
        "key_points": [
            "Motia is built on a core primitive: the Step",
            "Every backend pattern can be expressed with the same Step primitive",
            "Motia auto-discovers and connects Steps automatically",
            "Motia simplifies backend development similar to how React simplified frontend development with components",
            "Motia aims to unify various backend concerns into one system"

        "example": "The example provided demonstrates two Steps working together: an API Step that emits an event, and an Event Step that processes it.",
